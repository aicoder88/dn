# Gemini Audit Report

This report details the audit of the DriverNetwork Presentation repository and the fixes that were implemented.

## Audit Findings

* **Project Structure:** The project is a Next.js application with TypeScript, using a pages-based router. It is a presentation application for a company called "DriverNetwork".
* **Dependencies:** The project uses modern dependencies, including Next.js 15, React 19, and Tailwind CSS. However, there were some issues with the ESLint configuration.
* **Code Quality:** The main `index.tsx` file was very large and contained the code for all the slides, making it difficult to maintain. The `todo.md` file indicated that this was a known issue and that a refactoring was in progress.
* **Documentation:** The `README.md` file was well-structured but contained some inaccuracies. The `gemini.md` file was empty.

## Implemented Fixes

1.  **Migrated all slides to a component-based architecture:** All 17 slides were migrated from the main `index.tsx` file to their own components in the `src/components/slides` directory. This significantly improves the maintainability and performance of the application.
2.  **Fixed the ESLint configuration:** The ESLint configuration was updated to correctly handle TypeScript and JSX syntax. This ensures that the code is clean and consistent.
3.  **Updated the `README.md` file:** The `README.md` file was updated to remove inaccurate information about the use of `shadcn/ui`.
4.  **Created a `LICENSE` file:** A `LICENSE` file with the MIT License was created, as indicated in the `README.md` file.

## Remaining Tasks

The following tasks from the `todo.md` file are still pending:

*   **UI/Visual Improvements:** Typography, color scheme, and animations.
*   **User Experience Improvements:** Navigation, mobile responsiveness, and content structure.
*   **Technical Performance:** Chart optimization, bundle analysis, and performance testing.
*   **Accessibility:** ARIA labels, focus management, and screen reader announcements.
*   **Feature Enhancements:** Presentation tools and analytics.
